## üöÄ Getting Started: Setting Up Acharya Locally

Follow these steps to get Acharya up and running on your local machine for development or testing.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v18 or later recommended)
- npm, yarn, or pnpm
- Your chosen database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) installed and running, or access to a cloud database instance.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pushkar1713/acharya
    cd acharya # Or your project directory name
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install

    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project. Copy the contents of `.env.example` (if available) or manually add the following required variables. You'll need to obtain keys/credentials from the respective services.

    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
    CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/dashboard
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/dashboard
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname?sslmode=require"
    # GEMINI_API_BASE=...
    # UPLOAD_STORAGE_KEY=...
    ```

    **Replace placeholder values** (`...`, `pk_test_...`, `sk_test_...`, `sk-...`) with your actual credentials.

4.  **Set up the database schema:**
    Run the database migration script to apply the schema defined in your Drizzle ORM configuration.

    ```bash
    npm run migrate # Or npm run db:migrate / yarn db:migrate
    ```

    _(Confirm the exact script name in your `package.json` under `scripts`)_. This command uses Drizzle Kit to apply pending migrations to your database.

5.  **Run the development server:**
    Start the Next.js development server.

    ```bash
    npm run dev # Or npm run dev / yarn dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see Acharya in action!
